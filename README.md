# Python Fundamentals
This course is designed as an introductory course for those with little python experience. It is assumed that you have at least a basic understanding
of some concepts such as syntax, mathematic operators, variables, and functions. As students progress through the course they will be
introduced to new concepts and then apply those concepts to a program that they will build over the duration of the course.

This course will take students through a series of guided modules which, as a general rule, will follow this pattern:
1. Introduce a new concept
2. Provide code examples of this concept in action
3. Ask the student to complete practice exercises
4. apply the concept to the main program.

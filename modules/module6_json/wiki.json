Several species of pear are valued for their edible fruit and juices while others are cultivated as trees.\n\nThe tree is medium-sized and native to coastal as well as mildly temperate regions of Europe, north Africa and Asia. Pear wood is one of the preferred materials in the manufacture of high-quality [[woodwind]] instruments and [[furniture]].\n\nAbout 3000 known varieties of pears are grown worldwide. The fruit is consumed fresh, canned, as [[juice]], and [[dried fruit|dried]]. In 2017, world production of pears was 24 million [[tonne]]s, with [[China]] as the main producer.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word ''pear'' is probably from Germanic ''pera'' as a [[loanword]] of [[Vulgar Latin]] ''pira'', the plural of ''pirum'', akin to Greek ''apios'' (from Mycenaean ''ápisos''),<ref>{{OEtymD|pear}}</ref> of Semitic origin (''pirâ''), meaning \"fruit\". The adjective ''[[wikt:pyriform|pyriform]]'' or ''piriform'' means pear-shaped.\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:PearBlossomsCalifornia.jpg|thumb|Pear blossoms|left]]\n\nThe pear is [[native plant|native]] to coastal and mildly temperate regions of the [[Old World]], from western Europe and north Africa east right across Asia. It is a medium-sized tree, reaching {{convert|10|–|17|m|ft}} tall, often with a tall, narrow crown; a few species are [[shrub]]by.\n\nThe [[leaf|leaves]] are alternately arranged, simple, {{convert|2|–|12|cm|in}} long, glossy green on some species, densely silvery-hairy in some others; leaf shape varies from broad oval to narrow lanceolate. Most pears are [[deciduous]], but one or two species in southeast Asia are [[evergreen]]. Most are cold-hardy, withstanding temperatures between {{convert|−25|C|F}} and {{convert|−40|C|F}} in winter, except for the evergreen species, which only tolerate temperatures down to about {{convert|−15|C|F}}.\n\nThe [[flower]]s are white, rarely tinted yellow or pink, {{convert|2|–|4|cm|in}} diameter, and have five petals.<ref name=\"pearfruit\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20100916180243/http://bouquetoffruits.com/fruit-facts/pear-facts.html Pear Fruit Facts Page Information]. bouquetoffruits.com</ref> Like that of the related [[apple]], the pear fruit is a [[pome]], in most wild species {{convert|1|–|4|cm|in}} diameter, but in some cultivated forms up to {{convert|18|cm|in}} long and {{convert|8|cm|in}} broad; the shape varies in most species from oblate or globose, to the classic pyriform '[[pear shaped|pear-shape]]' of the [[European pear]] with an elongated basal portion and a bulbous end.\n\nThe fruit is composed of the receptacle or upper end of the flower-stalk (the so-called [[calyx (botany)|calyx]] tube) greatly dilated. Enclosed within its cellular flesh is the true fruit: five '[[Cartilage#Plants and fungi|cartilaginous]]' [[carpels]], known colloquially as the \"core\".

Because pears ripen from the inside out, the best way to judge ripeness is to \"check the neck\": apply gentle thumb pressure to the neck or stem end of the pear. If it yields to gentle pressure, then the pear is ripe, sweet, and juicy.  If it is firm, leave the pear at room temperature and check daily for ripeness.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usapears.org/Recipes%20And%20Lifestyle/Culinary%20Corner/Produce-Guide.aspx |title=Pear Bureau Northwest |publisher=Usapears.org |accessdate=14 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510223532/http://www.usapears.org/Recipes%20And%20Lifestyle/Culinary%20Corner/Produce-Guide.aspx |archive-date=10 May 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe culinary or cooking pear is green but dry and hard, and only edible after several hours of cooking.

Apple [[fruit tree|trees]] are [[agriculture|cultivated]] worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the [[genus]] ''[[Malus]]''. The tree originated in [[Central Asia]], where its wild ancestor, ''[[Malus sieversii]]'', is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in [[Asia]] and [[Europe]] and were brought to North America by [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonists]]. Apples have religious and [[mythology|mythological]] significance in many cultures, including [[Norse mythology|Norse]], [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Christianity in Europe|European Christian]] tradition.\n\nApple trees are large if grown from seed.  Generally, apple [[cultivar]]s are propagated by [[grafting]] onto [[rootstock]]s, which control the size of the resulting tree. There are more than 7,500 known [[List of apple cultivars|cultivars of apples]], resulting in a range of desired characteristics. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and use, including [[cooking apple|cooking]], eating raw and [[apple cider|cider]] production. Trees and fruit are prone to a number of [[fungus|fungal]], bacterial and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of [[organic farming|organic]] and non-organic means. In 2010, the fruit's [[genome]] was [[DNA sequencing|sequenced]] as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production.\n\nWorldwide production of apples in 2017 was 83.1&nbsp;million [[tonnes]], with China accounting for half of the total.<ref name=faostat/>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe word \"apple\", formerly spelled ''æppel'' in [[Old English]], is derived from the [[Proto-Germanic]] root *ap(a)laz, which could also mean [[fruit]] in general. This is ultimately derived from [[Proto-Indo-European]] *ab(e)l-, but the precise original meaning and the relationship between both words is uncertain.\n\nAs late as the 17th century, the word also functioned as a generic term for all fruit other than [[berries]] but including [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s—such as the 14th century [[Middle English]] word ''appel of paradis'', meaning a [[banana]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Origin and meaning of \"apple\" by Online Etymology Dictionary |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/apple |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=22 November 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> This use is analogous to the [[French language]] use of ''pomme''.\n\n==Description==\n\n[[File:Koeh-108.jpg|thumb|right|Blossoms, fruits, and leaves of the apple tree (''Malus domestica'')]]\n[[File:Pink lady and cross section.jpg|thumb|right|An apple's side, stem end, and interior]]\nThe apple is a [[deciduous]] tree, generally standing {{convert|6|to|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall in cultivation and up to {{convert|30|ft|m|abbr=on}} in the wild.<!--<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.treenames.net/ti/malus/index_apple_tree.html |title=Types and names of Apple Trees, Species of the Malus Genus |publisher=Treenames.net |accessdate=25 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915015547/http://www.treenames.net/ti/malus/index_apple_tree.html |archive-date=15 September 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>--> When cultivated, the size, shape and branch density are determined by [[rootstock]] selection and trimming method.

English scholar [[H. R. Ellis Davidson]] links apples to religious practices in [[Germanic paganism]], from which [[Norse paganism]] developed. She points out that buckets of apples were found in the [[Oseberg ship]] burial site in Norway, that fruit and nuts (Iðunn having been described as being transformed into a nut in ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'') have been found in the early graves of the [[Germanic peoples]] in England and elsewhere on the continent of Europe, which may have had a symbolic meaning, and that nuts are still a recognized symbol of [[fertility]] in southwest England.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nDavidson notes a connection between apples and the [[Vanir]], a tribe of gods associated with [[fertility]] in Norse mythology, citing an instance of eleven \"golden apples\" being given to woo the beautiful [[Gerðr]] by [[Skírnir]], who was acting as messenger for the major Vanir god [[Freyr]] in stanzas 19 and 20 of ''[[Skírnismál]]''. Davidson also notes a further connection between fertility and apples in Norse mythology in chapter 2 of the ''[[Völsunga saga]]'' when the major goddess [[Frigg]] sends King [[Rerir]] an apple after he prays to Odin for a child, Frigg's messenger (in the guise of a crow) drops the apple in his lap as he sits atop a [[tumulus|mound]].<ref name=\"DAVIDSON165-166\"/> Rerir's wife's consumption of the apple results in a six-year pregnancy and the [[Caesarean section]] birth of their son—the hero [[Völsung]].<ref name=\"DAVIDSONROLES146-147\"/>\n\nFurther, Davidson points out the \"strange\" phrase \"Apples of [[Hel (location)|Hel]]\" used in an 11th-century poem by the [[skald]] Thorbiorn Brúnarson. She states this may imply that the apple was thought of by Brúnarson as the food of the dead. Further, Davidson notes that the potentially Germanic goddess [[Nehalennia]] is sometimes depicted with apples and that parallels exist in early Irish stories. Davidson asserts that while cultivation of the apple in Northern Europe extends back to at least the time of the [[Roman Empire]] and came to Europe from the [[Near East]], the native varieties of apple trees growing in Northern Europe are small and bitter. Davidson concludes that in the figure of Iðunn \"we must have a dim reflection of an old symbol: that of the guardian goddess of the life-giving fruit of the other world.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\n===Greek mythology===\n[[File:Hercules Musei Capitolini MC1265 n2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.6|[[Heracles]] with the apple of [[Hesperides]]]]\nApples appear in many [[World religions|religious traditions]], often as a mystical or [[forbidden fruit]].

The aphid species can be identified by color, time of year, and by differences in the cornicles (small paired projections from their rear).<ref name=pest4/> Aphids feed on foliage using needle-like mouth parts to suck out plant juices.

Apples can be canned, dried or frozen.<ref name=applefood/> Canned or frozen apples are eventually baked into pies or other cooked dishes. Apple juice or cider is also bottled. Apple juice is often concentrated and frozen.\n\n===Popular uses===\nApples are often eaten raw. Cultivars bred for raw consumption are termed dessert or [[table apple]]s.\n* In the UK, a [[toffee apple]] is a traditional confection made by coating an apple in hot [[toffee]] and allowing it to cool. Similar treats in the U.S. are [[candy apple]]s (coated in a hard shell of crystallized sugar syrup) and [[caramel apples]] (coated with cooled [[caramel]]).\n* Apples are eaten with honey at the Jewish New Year of [[Rosh Hashanah]] to symbolize a sweet new year.<ref name=food/>\n\nApples are an important ingredient in many desserts, such as [[apple pie]], apple [[crumble]], [[apple crisp]] and [[apple cake]]. When cooked, some apple cultivars easily form a puree known as [[apple sauce]]. Apples are also made into [[apple butter]] and apple jelly. They are often [[baked]] or [[stewed]] and are also (cooked) in some meat dishes. Dried apples can be eaten or reconstituted (soaked in water, alcohol or some other liquid).\n\nApples are milled or pressed to produce [[apple juice]], which may be drunk unfiltered (called [[apple cider]] in North America), or filtered. Filtered juice is often concentrated and frozen, then reconstituted later and consumed. Apple juice can be [[fermentation (food)|fermented]] to make [[cider]] (called hard cider in North America), [[ciderkin]], and vinegar. Through [[distillation]], various alcoholic beverages can be produced, such as [[applejack (beverage)|applejack]], [[Calvados (spirit)|Calvados]], and [[apfelwein]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Edible Medicinal And Non-Medicinal Plants: Volume 4, Fruits|isbn=9789400740532|location=|pages=|last1=Lim|first1=T.

The fruit is variable in size, color, and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in [[starch]] covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown when ripe. The fruits grow in clusters hanging from the top of the plant. Almost all modern edible seedless ([[Parthenocarpy|parthenocarp]]) bananas come from two wild species&nbsp;– ''[[Musa acuminata]]'' and ''[[Musa balbisiana]]''. The [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific names]] of most cultivated bananas are ''Musa acuminata'', ''Musa balbisiana'', and [[Musa × paradisiaca|''Musa'' × ''paradisiaca'']] for the hybrid ''Musa acuminata'' × ''M.&nbsp;balbisiana'', depending on their [[genome|genomic]] constitution.

Especially in the Americas and Europe, \"banana\" usually refers to soft, sweet, dessert bananas, particularly those of the [[#Cavendish|Cavendish group]], which are the main exports from banana-growing countries. By contrast, [[List of banana cultivars|''Musa'' cultivars]] with firmer, starchier fruit are called \"plantains\". In other regions, such as [[Southeast Asia]], many more kinds of banana are grown and eaten, so the binary distinction is not useful and is not made in local languages.\n\nThe term \"banana\" is also used as the common name for the plants that produce the fruit.<ref name=MW/> This can extend to other members of the genus ''Musa'', such as the [[Musa coccinea|scarlet banana]] (''Musa coccinea''), the [[Musa velutina|pink banana]] (''Musa velutina''), and the [[Fe'i banana]]s. It can also refer to members of the genus ''[[Ensete]]'', such as the [[Ensete glaucum|snow banana]] (''Ensete glaucum'') and the economically important [[Ensete ventricosum|false banana]] (''Ensete ventricosum''). Both genera are in the banana family, [[Musaceae]].\n\n==Description==\n<gallery>\nFile:Banana corm.jpg|A banana corm, about {{convert|25|cm|in|abbr=on|0}} across\nFile:M. acuminata x balbisiana female flower detail.jpg|Female flowers have petals at the tip of the ovary\nFile:2018 06 TropicalIslands IMG 2170.jpg|Banana 'tree' showing fruit and [[inflorescence]]\nFile:Banana tree in Chandigarh.jpg|Banana tree with opening inflorescence\nFile:M. acuminata x balbisiana.JPG|Banana inflorescence, partially opened\nFile:Banana three in Réunion.jpg|Wild banana with flowers and stem growing in reverse direction\nFile:Banana's DNA Strand.jpg|Extracted banana's DNA strands that can be seen with naked eyes\n</gallery>\n\n[[File:Baby Banana Plant.jpg|thumb|upright|Young banana plant]]\nThe banana plant is the largest [[herbaceous]] flowering plant.<ref name=PicqINIB00/> All the above-ground parts of a banana plant grow from a structure usually called a \"[[corm]]\".{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|pp=5–9}} Plants are normally tall and fairly sturdy, and are often mistaken for [[tree]]s, but what appears to be a trunk is actually a \"false stem\" or [[pseudostem]]. Bananas grow in a wide variety of soils, as long as the soil is at least 60&nbsp;cm deep, has good drainage and is not compacted.{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|p=212}} The leaves of banana plants are composed of a \"stalk\" ([[petiole (botany)|petiole]]) and a blade ([[Leaf#General characteristics of leaves|lamina]]). The base of the petiole widens to form a sheath; the tightly packed sheaths make up the pseudostem, which is all that supports the plant. The edges of the sheath meet when it is first produced, making it tubular. As new growth occurs in the centre of the pseudostem the edges are forced apart.{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|pp=13–17}} Cultivated banana plants vary in height depending on the variety and growing conditions. Most are around {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} tall, with a range from 'Dwarf Cavendish' plants at around {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} to 'Gros Michel' at {{convert|7|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} or more.{{sfn|Nelson|Ploetz|Kepler|2006|p=26}}{{sfn|Ploetz|Kepler|Daniells|Nelson|2007|p=12}} Leaves are spirally arranged and may grow {{convert|2.7|m|ft}} long and {{convert|60|cm|ft|abbr=on}} wide.<ref name=\"purdue1\"/> They are easily torn by the wind, resulting in the familiar frond look.<ref name=Greenearth/>\n\nWhen a banana plant is mature, the corm stops producing new leaves and begins to form a flower spike or [[inflorescence]]. A stem develops which grows up inside the pseudostem, carrying the immature inflorescence until eventually it emerges at the top.{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|pp=9–13}} Each pseudostem normally produces a single inflorescence, also known as the \"banana heart\". (More are sometimes produced; an exceptional plant in the [[Philippines]] produced five.<ref name=ABS_CBN/>) After fruiting, the pseudostem dies, but offshoots will normally have developed from the base, so that the plant as a whole is [[perennial]]. In the plantation system of cultivation, only one of the offshoots will be allowed to develop in order to maintain spacing.{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|pp=244–247}} The inflorescence contains many [[bract]]s (sometimes incorrectly referred to as petals) between rows of flowers. The female flowers (which can develop into fruit) appear in rows further up the stem (closer to the leaves) from the rows of male flowers. The ovary is [[ovary (plants)|inferior]], meaning that the tiny petals and other flower parts appear at the tip of the ovary.{{sfn|Office of the Gene Technology Regulator|2008}}\n\nThe banana fruits develop from the banana heart, in a large hanging cluster, made up of tiers (called \"hands\"), with up to 20 fruit to a tier. The hanging cluster is known as a bunch, comprising 3–20 [[wikt:tier#noun 2|tiers]], or commercially as a \"banana stem\", and can weigh {{convert|30|–|50|kg|lb}}. Individual banana fruits (commonly known as a banana or \"finger\") average {{convert|125|g|lb}}, of which approximately 75% is [[water]] and 25% dry matter (nutrient table, lower right).\n\nThe fruit has been described as a \"leathery berry\".<ref name=Smit77/> There is a protective outer layer (a [[Peel (fruit)|peel]] or skin) with numerous long, thin strings (the [[phloem]] [[Vascular bundle|bundles]]), which run lengthwise between the skin and the [[Eating|edible]] inner portion. The inner part of the common yellow dessert variety can be split lengthwise into three sections that correspond to the inner portions of the three [[carpel]]s by manually deforming the unopened fruit.<ref name=Wark04/> In cultivated varieties, the seeds are diminished nearly to non-existence; their remnants are tiny black specks in the interior of the fruit.<ref name=Simm62/>\n\n===Banana equivalent radiation dose===\n\nAs with all potassium-containing objects on Earth, including many common foods and people, bananas emit [[radioactivity]] at very low levels occurring naturally from [[potassium-40]] (<sup>40</sup>K or K-40),<ref name=\"frame\">{{cite web |author1=Paul Frame |title=General information about K-40 |url=https://www.orau.org/ptp/collection/consumer%20products/potassiumgeneralinfo.htm |publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory |accessdate=April 24, 2019 |date=January 20, 2009|quote=The human body maintains relatively tight homeostatic control over potassium levels.

The [[APG III system]] assigns Musaceae to the order [[Zingiberales]], part of the [[commelinid]] clade of the [[monocotyledon]]ous flowering plants. Some 70 species of ''Musa'' were recognized by the [[World Checklist of Selected Plant Families]] {{asof|2013|January|lc=yes}};<ref name=WCSP_Musa/> several produce edible fruit, while others are cultivated as ornamentals.<ref name=Bail16/>\n\nThe classification of cultivated bananas has long been a problematic issue for taxonomists. Linnaeus originally placed bananas into two species based only on their uses as food: ''Musa sapientum'' for dessert bananas and ''Musa paradisiaca'' for [[Plantain (true)|plantains]]. More species names were added, but this approach proved to be inadequate for the number of [[cultivar]]s in the primary center of diversity of the genus, Southeast Asia. Many of these cultivars were given names that were later discovered to be [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]].{{sfn|Valmayor|Jamaluddin|Silayoi|Kusumo|2000}}\n\nIn a series of papers published from 1947 onwards, Ernest Cheesman showed that Linnaeus's ''Musa sapientum'' and ''Musa paradisiaca'' were cultivars and descendants of two wild seed-producing species, ''[[Musa acuminata]]'' and ''[[Musa balbisiana]]'', both first described by [[Luigi Aloysius Colla]].<ref name=DRC/> Cheesman recommended the abolition of Linnaeus's species in favor of reclassifying bananas according to three morphologically distinct groups of cultivars – those primarily exhibiting the botanical characteristics of ''Musa balbisiana'', those primarily exhibiting the botanical characteristics of ''Musa acuminata'', and those with characteristics of both.{{sfn|Valmayor|Jamaluddin|Silayoi|Kusumo|2000}} Researchers Norman Simmonds and Ken Shepherd proposed a genome-based nomenclature system in 1955. This system eliminated almost all the difficulties and inconsistencies of the earlier classification of bananas based on assigning scientific names to cultivated varieties. Despite this, the original names are still recognized by some authorities, leading to confusion.<ref name=DRC/><ref name=Porc02/>\n\nThe accepted [[Botanical name|scientific names]] for most groups of cultivated bananas are ''Musa acuminata'' <small>Colla</small> and ''Musa balbisiana'' <small>Colla</small> for the ancestral species, and ''Musa'' × ''paradisiaca'' <small>L.</small> for the hybrid ''M. acuminata'' × ''M. balbisiana''.<ref name=WCSP_Mp/>\n\n[[Synonym (taxonomy)|Synonyms]] of ''M.'' × ''paradisica'' include\n* many subspecific and varietial names of ''M.'' × ''paradisiaca'', including ''M. p.'' subsp. ''sapientum'' <small>(L.) Kuntze</small>\n* ''Musa'' × ''dacca'' <small>Horan.</small>\n* ''Musa'' × ''sapidisiaca'' <small>K.C.Jacob, nom. superfl.</small>\n* ''Musa'' × ''sapientum'' <small>L.</small>, and many of its varietal names, including ''M.'' × ''sapientum'' var. ''paradisiaca'' <small>(L.) Baker, nom. illeg.</small>\n\nGenerally, modern classifications of banana cultivars follow Simmonds and Shepherd's system. Cultivars are placed in groups based on the number of chromosomes they have and which species they are derived from. Thus the [[Latundan banana]] is placed in the AAB Group, showing that it is a triploid derived from both ''M. acuminata'' (A) and ''M. balbisiana'' (B). For a list of the cultivars classified under this system, ''see'' \"[[List of banana cultivars]]\".\n\nIn 2012, a team of scientists announced they had achieved a draft sequence of the genome of ''[[Musa acuminata]]''.<ref name=dHon12/>\n\n==Bananas and plantains==\nIn regions such as North America and Europe, ''Musa'' fruits offered for sale can be divided into \"bananas\" and \"[[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]]\", based on their intended use as food. Thus the banana producer and distributor [[Chiquita Brands International|Chiquita]] produces publicity material for the American market which says that \"a plantain is not a banana\". The stated differences are that plantains are more [[starch]]y and less sweet; they are eaten cooked rather than raw; they have thicker skin, which may be green, yellow or black; and they can be used at any stage of ripeness.<ref name=Chiquita/> Linnaeus made the same distinction between plantains and bananas when first naming two \"species\" of ''Musa''.{{sfn|Valmayor|Jamaluddin|Silayoi|Kusumo|2000|p=2}} Members of the \"[[Plantain (true)|plantain subgroup]]\" of banana cultivars, most important as food in West Africa and Latin America, correspond to the Chiquita description, having long pointed fruit. They are described by Ploetz et al. as \"true\" plantains, distinct from other cooking bananas.{{sfn|Ploetz|Kepler|Daniells|Nelson|2007|pp=18–19}} The cooking bananas of East Africa belong to a different group, the [[East African Highland banana]]s,{{sfn|Ploetz|Kepler|Daniells|Nelson|2007|p=12}} so would not qualify as \"true\" plantains on this definition.\n[[File:Bananas white background DS.jpg|thumb|[[Cavendish bananas]] are the most common dessert bananas sold]]\nAn alternative approach divides bananas into dessert bananas and cooking bananas, with plantains being one of the subgroups of cooking bananas.{{sfn|Office of the Gene Technology Regulator|2008|p=1}} [[Polyploid|Triploid]] cultivars derived solely from ''M.&nbsp;acuminata'' are examples of \"dessert bananas\", whereas triploid cultivars derived from the hybrid between ''M.&nbsp;acuminata'' and ''M.&nbsp;balbinosa'' (in particular the plantain subgroup of the [[List of banana cultivars#AAB Group|AAB Group]]) are \"plantains\".<ref name=StovSimm87p183/><ref name=QiMoorOrch00/> Small farmers in [[Colombia]] grow a much wider range of cultivars than large commercial plantations. A study of these cultivars showed that they could be placed into at least three groups based on their characteristics: dessert bananas, non-plantain cooking bananas, and plantains, although there were overlaps between dessert and cooking bananas.<ref name=GibeDufoGiraSanc09/>\n\nIn Southeast Asia – the center of diversity for bananas, both wild and cultivated – the distinction between \"bananas\" and \"plantains\" does not work, according to Valmayor et al. Many bananas are used both raw and cooked. There are starchy cooking bananas which are smaller than those eaten raw. The range of colors, sizes and shapes is far wider than in those grown or sold in Africa, Europe or the Americas.{{sfn|Valmayor|Jamaluddin|Silayoi|Kusumo|2000|p=2}} Southeast Asian languages do not make the distinction between \"bananas\" and \"plantains\" that is made in English (and Spanish). Thus both [[#Cavendish|Cavendish cultivars]], the classic yellow dessert bananas, and [[Saba banana|Saba cultivars]], used mainly for cooking, are called ''pisang'' in [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]], ''kluai'' in [[Thailand]] and ''chuoi'' in [[Vietnam]].{{sfn|Valmayor|Jamaluddin|Silayoi|Kusumo|2000|pp=8–12}} [[Fe'i banana]]s, grown and eaten in the islands of the Pacific, are derived from entirely different wild species than traditional bananas and plantains. Most Fe'i bananas are cooked, but [[Karat banana]]s, which are short and squat with bright red skins, very different from the usual yellow dessert bananas, are eaten raw.<ref name=Engl03/>\n\nIn summary, in commerce in Europe and the Americas (although not in small-scale cultivation), it is possible to distinguish between \"bananas\", which are eaten raw, and \"plantains\", which are cooked. In other regions of the world, particularly India, Southeast Asia and the islands of the Pacific, there are many more kinds of banana and the two-fold distinction is not useful and not made in local languages. Plantains are one of many kinds of cooking bananas, which are not always distinct from dessert bananas.\n\n==Historical cultivation==\n\n===Early cultivation===\n{{See also|Musa acuminata|Domesticated plants and animals of Austronesia|East African Highland bananas}}\n[[File:Banana ancestors (Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana) original range.png|thumb|Original [[Range (biology)|native ranges]] of the ancestors of modern edible bananas.

Numerous [[phytolith]]s of bananas have been recovered from the [[Kuk Swamp]] archaeological site and dated to around 10,000 to 6,500 [[Before Present|BP]].

They [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]ized with other (possibly independently domesticated) [[subspecies]] of ''[[Musa acuminata]]'' as well as ''[[Musa balbisiana]]'' in the [[Philippines]], northern New Guinea, and possibly [[Halmahera]]. These hybridization events produced the [[triploid]] [[List of banana cultivars|cultivars of bananas]] commonly grown today.

North American shippers like [[Lorenzo Dow Baker]] and [[Andrew Preston]], the founders of the [[Boston Fruit Company]] started this process in the 1870s, but railroad builders like [[Minor C. Keith]] also participated, eventually culminating in the multi-national giant corporations like today's [[Chiquita Brands International]] and [[Dole Food Company|Dole]].<ref name=Koep08/> These companies were [[monopoly|monopolistic]], [[vertically integrated]] (meaning they controlled growing, processing, shipping and marketing) and usually used political manipulation to build [[enclave economy|enclave economies]] (economies that were internally self-sufficient, virtually tax exempt, and export-oriented that contribute very little to the host economy). Their political maneuvers, which gave rise to the term [[Banana republic]] for states like Honduras and Guatemala, included working with local elites and their rivalries to influence politics or playing the international interests of the United States, especially during the [[Cold War]], to keep the political climate favorable to their interests.<ref name=NZH/>\n\n===Peasant cultivation for export in the Caribbean===\n{{Main|History of peasant banana production in the Americas}}\n\nThe vast majority of the world's bananas today are cultivated for family consumption or for sale on local markets. India is the world leader in this sort of production, but many other Asian and African countries where climate and soil conditions allow cultivation also host large populations of banana growers who sell at least some of their crop.{{sfn|Office of the Gene Technology Regulator|2008|pp=7–8}}\n\nPeasant sector banana growers produce for the world market in the Caribbean, however. The [[Windward Islands]] are notable for the growing, largely of Cavendish bananas, for an international market, generally in Europe but also in North America. In the Caribbean, and especially in Dominica where this sort of cultivation is widespread, holdings are in the 1–2 acre range. In many cases the farmer earns additional money from other crops, from engaging in labor outside the farm, and from a share of the earnings of relatives living overseas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coursehero.com/file/poj7td/The-earliest-modern-plantations-originated-in-Jamaica-and-the-related-Western/|title=The earliest modern plantations originated in Jamaica and the related Western|work=www.coursehero.com|language=en|access-date=May 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\nBanana crops are vulnerable to destruction by high winds, such as tropical storms or [[cyclone]]s.{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|pp=206–207}}\n\n==Modern cultivation==\nAll widely cultivated bananas today descend from the two wild bananas ''Musa acuminata'' and ''Musa balbisiana''. While the original wild bananas contained large seeds, [[diploid]] or [[polyploid]] cultivars (some being [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]]) with tiny seeds are preferred for human raw fruit consumption.<ref name=Cast09/> These are propagated [[asexual reproduction|asexually]] from offshoots. The plant is allowed to produce two shoots at a time; a larger one for immediate fruiting and a smaller \"sucker\" or \"follower\" to produce fruit in 6–8 months.\n\nAs a non-seasonal crop, bananas are available fresh year-round.<ref>{{cite web|title=How bananas are grown|url=http://www.bananalink.org.uk/how-bananas-are-grown|website=Banana Link|accessdate=September 2, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160906115526/http://www.bananalink.org.uk/how-bananas-are-grown|archivedate=September 6, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Cavendish===\n{{main|Cavendish bananas}}\n[[File:Bananas.jpg|thumb|alt=Grocery store photo of several bunches of bananas|[[Cavendish bananas]] are the main commercial banana cultivars sold in the world market.]]\n\nIn global commerce in 2009, by far the most important cultivars belonged to the triploid [[List of banana cultivars#AAA Group|AAA]] [[cultivar group|group]] of ''Musa acuminata'', commonly referred to as Cavendish group bananas. They accounted for the majority of banana exports,<ref name=Cast09/> despite only coming into existence in 1836.<ref name=Homecooking/> The cultivars [[Dwarf Cavendish]] and [[Grand Nain]] (Chiquita Banana) gained popularity in the 1950s after the previous mass-produced cultivar, [[Gros Michel banana|Gros Michel]] (also an AAA group cultivar), became commercially unviable due to [[Panama disease]], caused by the fungus ''[[Fusarium oxysporum]]'' which attacks the roots of the banana plant.<ref name=Cast09/> Cavendish cultivars are resistant to the Panama disease, but in 2013 there were fears that the [[black sigatoka]] fungus would in turn make Cavendish bananas unviable.<ref name=Holmes/>\n\nEven though it is no longer viable for large scale cultivation, Gros Michel is not extinct and is still grown in areas where Panama disease is not found.<ref name=straightdope/> Likewise, Dwarf Cavendish and Grand Nain are in no danger of extinction, but they may leave supermarket shelves if disease makes it impossible to supply the global market. It is unclear if any existing cultivar can replace Cavendish bananas, so various [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridisation]] and [[genetic engineering]] programs are attempting to create a disease-resistant, mass-market banana.<ref name=Cast09/>  One such strain that has emerged is the Taiwanese Cavendish, also known as the Formosana.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gittleson |first1=Kim|title=Battling to save the world's bananas| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42777803 |accessdate=April 18, 2018| agency=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=February 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Ripening===\nExport bananas are picked green, and ripen in special rooms upon arrival in the destination country. These rooms are air-tight and filled with [[Ethylene|ethylene gas]] to induce ripening. The vivid yellow color consumers normally associate with supermarket bananas is, in fact, caused by the artificial ripening process.<ref name=Ding07/> Flavor and texture are also affected by ripening temperature. Bananas are refrigerated to between {{convert|13.5|and|15|C|F}} during transport. At lower temperatures, ripening permanently stalls, and the bananas turn gray as cell walls break down. The skin of ripe bananas quickly blackens in the {{convert|4|C}} environment of a domestic [[refrigerator]], although the fruit inside remains unaffected.\n[[File:Banana-fluorescence-081108.jpg|thumb|left|Ripened bananas (left, under [[sunlight]]) fluoresce in blue when exposed to [[UV light]].|alt=Two adjacent photos of bananas. The left is in sunlight; the right is under ultraviolet light.]]\n\nBananas can be ordered by the retailer \"ungassed\" (''i.e.'' not treated with ethylene), and may show up at the supermarket fully green. {{lang|es|[[Guineos verdes]]}} (green bananas) that have not been gassed will never fully ripen before becoming rotten. Instead of fresh eating, these bananas can be used for cooking, as seen in Jamaican cuisine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mnn.com/food/healthy-eating/stories/4-ways-use-green-bananas-wont-ripen|title=4 ways to use green bananas that won't ripen|last=Kirschner|first=Chanie|date=January 21, 2016|website=[[Mother Nature Network]]|access-date=April 30, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428035449/http://www.mnn.com/food/healthy-eating/stories/4-ways-use-green-bananas-wont-ripen|archivedate=April 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\nA 2008 study reported that ripe bananas [[fluoresce]] when exposed to [[ultraviolet]] light. This property is attributed to the degradation of [[chlorophyll]] leading to the accumulation of a fluorescent product in the skin of the fruit. The chlorophyll [[breakdown product]] is stabilized by a [[propionate]] [[ester]] group. Banana-plant leaves also fluoresce in the same way. Green (under-ripe) bananas do not fluoresce.<ref name=Mose08/> That paper suggested that this fluorescence could be put to use \"for optical in vivo monitoring of ripening and over-ripening of bananas and other fruit.\"\n{{clear}}\n\n===Storage and transport===\nBananas must be transported over long distances from the tropics to world markets.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=biUhdI19b18C|page=1}}|title=The World Banana Economy, 1985-2002|last=FAO)|first=Pedro Arias (Asesor da|date=2003|publisher=Food & Agriculture Org.|isbn=9789251050576|language=en}}</ref> To obtain maximum shelf life, harvest comes before the fruit is mature. The fruit requires careful handling, rapid transport to ports, cooling, and refrigerated shipping. The goal is to prevent the bananas from producing their natural ripening agent, ethylene. This technology allows storage and transport for 3–4 weeks at {{convert|13|C}}. On arrival, bananas are held at about {{convert|17|C}} and treated with a low concentration of ethylene. After a few days, the fruit begins to ripen and is distributed for final sale. Ripe bananas can be held for a few days at home. If bananas are too green, they can be put in a brown paper bag with an apple or tomato overnight to speed up the ripening process.<ref name=ChiquitaRipen/>\n\nCarbon dioxide (which bananas produce) and ethylene absorbents extend fruit life even at high temperatures. This effect can be exploited by packing banana in a [[polyethylene]] bag and including an ethylene absorbent, e.g., [[potassium permanganate]], on an inert carrier. The bag is then sealed with a band or string. This treatment has been shown to more than double lifespans up to 3–4 weeks without the need for refrigeration.<ref name=Scot70/><ref name=Scot71/><ref name=Scot74/>\n\n==Production and export==\n{{Image frame\n|width=520<!-- Must be kept at this size at this point (December 2017) -->\n|content ={{Global Heat Maps by Year| title=| table=Banana production.tab| column=tonnes| columnName=tonnes of bananas per year| year=2014|%=}}\n|caption=Annual banana production, measured in tonnes per year.<ref>{{cite web |title=Banana production |url=https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/banana-production |website=Our World in Data |accessdate=October 7, 2019}}</ref>\n|align=right\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"   style=\"float:right; clear:left; width:21em;\"\n|+ 2017 production (in millions of tonnes)\n|-\n!  style=\"background:#ddf; width:70%;\"| \n!  style=\"background:#ddf; width:10%;\"| Bananas\n!  style=\"background:#ddf; width:10%;\"| Plantains\n!  style=\"background:#ddf; width:10%;\"| Total\n|-\n|{{IND}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|30.5||&nbsp;||style=\"text-align:center;\"|30.5\n|-\n|{{CHN}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|11.2||&nbsp;||style=\"text-align:center;\"|11.2\n|-\n|{{PHL}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|6.1||style=\"text-align:center;\"|3.1||style=\"text-align:center;\"|9.2\n|-\n|{{COL}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|3.8||style=\"text-align:center;\"|3.6||style=\"text-align:center;\"|7.4\n|-\n|{{IDN}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|7.2||&nbsp;||style=\"text-align:center;\"|7.2\n|-\n|{{ECU}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|6.3||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0.8||style=\"text-align:center;\"|7.1\n|-\n|{{BRA}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|6.7||&nbsp;||style=\"text-align:center;\"|6.7\n|-\n|{{CMR}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|1.3||style=\"text-align:center;\"|4.5||style=\"text-align:center;\"|5.8\n|-\n|{{DRC}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0.3||style=\"text-align:center;\"|4.8||style=\"text-align:center;\"|5.1\n|-\n|{{ANG}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|4.3||&nbsp;||style=\"text-align:center;\"|4.3\n|-\n|{{GUA}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|3.9||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0.4||style=\"text-align:center;\"|4.3\n|-\n|{{GHA}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0.1||style=\"text-align:center;\"|4.1||style=\"text-align:center;\"|4.2\n|-\n|{{TAN}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|3.5||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0.6||style=\"text-align:center;\"|4.1\n|-\n|{{UGA}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0.6||style=\"text-align:center;\"|3.3||style=\"text-align:center;\"|3.9\n|-\n|{{NGR}}||&nbsp;||style=\"text-align:center;\"|3.2||style=\"text-align:center;\"|3.2\n|-\n|{{CRI}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|2.6||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0.1||style=\"text-align:center;\"|2.7\n|-\n|{{PER}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0.3||style=\"text-align:center;\"|2.0||style=\"text-align:center;\"|2.3\n|-\n|{{MEX}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|2.2||style=\"text-align:center;\"| ||style=\"text-align:center;\"|2.2\n|-\n|{{DOM}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|1.2||style=\"text-align:center;\"|1.0||style=\"text-align:center;\"|2.2\n|-\n|{{VIE}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|2.1||style=\"text-align:center;\"| ||style=\"text-align:center;\"|2.1\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: center;\" |'''World'''||style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''113.9'''||style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''39.2'''||style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''153.1'''\n|-\n|colspan=4|<small>Source: [[FAOSTAT]] of the [[United Nations]]<ref name=\"faostat17\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QC|title=Banana production in 2017, Crops/Regions/World list/Production Quantity (pick lists)|date=2018|publisher=UN Food and Agriculture Organization, Corporate Statistical Database (FAOSTAT)|accessdate=September 14, 2019}}</ref><ref>http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QC</ref> Note: Some countries distinguish between bananas and plantains, but four of the top six producers do not, thus necessitating comparisons using the total for bananas and plantains combined.</small>\n|}\n\nIn 2017, world production of bananas and plantains combined was 153 million tonnes, led by [[India]] and [[China]] with a combined total of 27% of global production {{cn|date=November 2019}}.

Its predecessor '[[Gros Michel]]', discovered in the 1820s, suffered this fate. Like almost all bananas, Cavendish lacks genetic diversity, which makes it vulnerable to diseases, threatening both commercial cultivation and small-scale subsistence farming.<ref name=NS060613/><ref name=Mont03/> Some commentators remarked that those variants which could replace what much of the world considers a \"typical banana\" are so different that most people would not consider them the same fruit, and blame the decline of the banana on [[mendelian inheritance|monogenetic]] cultivation driven by short-term commercial motives.<ref name=NZH/>\n\n===Panama disease===\n[[Panama disease]] is caused by a [[fusarium]] soil [[fungus]] (Race 1), which enters the plants through the roots and travels with water into the trunk and leaves, producing [[gel]]s and gums that cut off the flow of water and nutrients, causing the plant to [[wilting|wilt]], and exposing the rest of the plant to lethal amounts of sunlight. Prior to 1960, almost all commercial banana production centered on \"Gros Michel\", which was highly susceptible.<ref name=Bark08/> Cavendish was chosen as the replacement for Gros Michel because, among resistant cultivars, it produces the highest quality [[fruit]]. However, more care is required for shipping the Cavendish,<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Natasha|last=Frost|date=February 28, 2018|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/gros-michel-bananas|magazine=Atlas Obscura|title=A Quest for the Gros Michel, the Great Banana of Yesteryear|accessdate=July 24, 2019}}</ref> and its quality compared to Gros Michel is debated.<ref name=\"Lessard\">{{Cite book |title=The Complete Book of Bananas |last=Lessard |first=William |year=1992 |isbn=978-0963316103 |pages=27–28}}</ref>\n\nAccording to current sources, a deadly form of Panama disease is infecting Cavendish.

It affects all main cultivars of bananas and plantains (including the Cavendish cultivars<ref name =Holmes/>), impeding [[photosynthesis]] by blackening parts of the leaves, eventually killing the entire leaf. Starved for energy, fruit production falls by 50% or more, and the bananas that do grow [[ripening|ripen]] prematurely, making them unsuitable for export.

Depending upon cultivar and ripeness, the flesh can vary in taste from starchy to sweet, and texture from firm to mushy. Both the skin and inner part can be eaten raw or cooked. The primary component of the aroma of fresh bananas is [[isoamyl acetate]] (also known as ''banana oil''), which, along with several other compounds such as [[butyl acetate]] and [[isobutyl acetate]], is a significant contributor to banana flavor.<ref name=Fahl00/><ref name=Mui02/><ref name=Salm96/>\n\nDuring the ripening process, bananas produce the gas [[ethylene]], which acts as a [[plant hormone]] and indirectly affects the flavor. Among other things, ethylene stimulates the formation of [[amylase]], an [[enzyme]] that breaks down starch into sugar, influencing the taste of bananas. The greener, less ripe bananas contain higher levels of starch and, consequently, have a \"starchier\" taste. On the other hand, yellow bananas taste sweeter due to higher sugar concentrations. Furthermore, ethylene signals the production of [[pectinase]], an enzyme which breaks down the [[pectin]] between the cells of the banana, causing the banana to soften as it ripens.<ref name=plantphys/><ref name=newton/>\n\nBananas are eaten deep fried, baked in their skin in a split [[bamboo]], or steamed in [[glutinous rice]] wrapped in a banana leaf. Bananas can be made into [[fruit preserves]]. Banana [[pancake]]s are popular among travelers in [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. This has elicited the expression ''[[Banana Pancake Trail]]'' for those places in [[Asia]] that cater to these travelers. [[Banana chips]] are a snack produced from sliced dehydrated or fried banana or plantain, which have a dark brown color and an intense banana taste. Dried bananas are also ground to make [[banana flour]]. Extracting juice is difficult, because when a banana is compressed, it simply turns to pulp. Bananas feature prominently in [[Philippine cuisine]], being part of traditional dishes and desserts like ''[[Maruya (Filipino cuisine)|maruya]]'', ''[[Turón (food)|turón]]'', and ''[[halo-halo]]'' or ''saba con yelo''. Most of these dishes use the [[Saba Banana]] or Cardaba banana cultivar. Bananas are also commonly used in cuisine in the South-Indian state of [[Kerala]], where they are steamed (''puzhungiyathu''), made into curries,<ref name=pazhampachadi/> fried into chips, (''upperi'')<ref name=Hindu130413/> or fried in batter (''pazhampori'').<ref name=Hindu110228/> [[Pisang goreng]], bananas fried with batter similar to the Filipino ''maruya'' or Kerala ''pazhampori'', is a popular dessert in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia. A similar dish is known in the United Kingdom and United States as banana [[fritter]]s.\n\nPlantains are used in various stews and curries or cooked, baked or mashed in much the same way as [[potatoes]], such as the [[pazham pachadi]] dish prepared in [[Kerala]].<ref name=pazhampachadi/>\n\n{{multiple image|perrow=4|\n|width=160 | height=170\n|align=center\n|image1=అరటికాయ మరియు నిమ్మకాయ పులుసు కూర.jpg\n|caption1=Banana with Lemon curry made in a house in Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, India\n|image2 =Bananajf.jpg\n|caption2 =''Kilawin na pusô ng saging'', a [[Cuisine of the Philippines|Filipino dish]] using banana flowers\n|image3 =Nacatamales in steamer.jpg\n|caption3=Nicaraguan [[Nacatamal]]es, in banana leaves, ready to be steamed\n|image4 =Kaeng yuak.JPG\n|caption4= ''Kaeng yuak'' is a northern [[Thai curry]] made with the core of the banana plant\n|image5=Pisang goreng in a basket.jpg\n|caption5=''[[Pisang goreng]]'' fried banana coated in batter,  [[Indonesian cuisine|popular snack in Indonesia]]\n|image6=YosriPengatPisang.jpg\n|caption6=Banana in sweet gravy, known as ''pengat pisang'' in Malaysia\n}}\n\n====Flower====\nBanana hearts are used as a [[vegetable]]<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.asiafood.org/glossary_1.cfm?alpha=B&wordid=3219&startno=1&endno=25 |title=Encyclopedia of Asian Food |year=1998 |last=Solomon |first=C |publisher=New Holland Publishers |location=Australia |edition=Periplus |accessdate=May 17, 2008 |isbn=978-0-85561-688-5 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603142416/http://www.asiafood.org/glossary_1.cfm?alpha=B&wordid=3219&startno=1&endno=25 |archive-date=June 3, 2008 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> in [[South Asian cuisine|South Asian]] and [[Southeast Asian cuisine]], either raw or steamed with dips or cooked in soups, curries and fried foods.<ref>[http://www.dudaonline.com/southeast-asia/thailand/fried-banana-flowers/ Fried banana flowers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405093613/http://www.dudaonline.com/southeast-asia/thailand/fried-banana-flowers/ |date=April 5, 2011 }}.

These banana shoots produce fibers of varying degrees of softness, yielding yarns and textiles with differing qualities for specific uses. For example, the outermost fibers of the shoots are the coarsest, and are suitable for [[tablecloth]]s, while the softest innermost fibers are desirable for [[kimono]] and [[hakama|kamishimo]].

They are more sour and refreshing, with juicier flesh and a stronger taste. The sour pitaya or ''pitaya agria'' (''[[Stenocereus gummosus|S. gummosus]]'') in the [[Sonoran Desert]] has been an important food source for [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]]. The [[Seri people]] of northwestern Mexico still harvest the fruit, and call the plant ''ziix is ccapxl'' \"thing whose fruit is sour\". The fruit of related species, such as ''[[Stenocereus queretaroensis|S. queretaroensis]]'' and the dagger cactus (''[[Stenocereus griseus|S. griseus]]''), are also locally important foods. The fruit of the organ pipe cactus (''[[Stenocereus thurberi|S. thurberi]]'', called ''ool'' by the Seris) is the ''pitaya dulce'' \"sweet pitaya\". It has a more tart aroma than ''Hylocereus'' fruit, described as somewhat reminiscent of [[watermelon]].{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n=== Dragon fruit ''Hylocereus'' ===\n\n[[File:Dragon fruit.JPG|thumb|upright|Ripe dragon fruit in Vietnam]]\nSweet pitayas come in three types, all with leathery, slightly leafy skin:\n* ''[[Hylocereus undatus]]'' (''Pitaya blanca'' or white-fleshed pitaya) has pink-skinned fruit with white flesh. This is the most commonly seen \"dragon fruit\".\n* ''[[Hylocereus costaricensis]]'' (''Pitaya roja'' or red-fleshed pitaya, also known as ''Hylocereus polyrhizus'') has red-skinned fruit with red flesh.  \n* ''[[Hylocereus megalanthus]]'' (''Pitaya amarilla'' or yellow pitaya, also known as ''Selenicereus megalanthus'') has yellow-skinned fruit with white flesh.\n\nThe fruit normally weighs from {{convert|150 to 600|g}}; some may reach {{convert|1|kg}}. Early imports from [[Colombia]] to [[Australia]] were designated ''Hylocereus ocampensis'' (or ''[[Cereus repandus]]'', the red fruit) and ''Cereus triangularis'' (supposedly, the yellow fruit). It is not quite certain to which species these [[taxa]] refer.\n\n== Cultivation ==\n[[File:Pitaya (seedling).jpg|thumb|right|Pitaya seedling]]\n[[File:Lianjiang County - Dongdai Town - Yangguang Dragong Fruit Farm - P1510432.JPG|thumb|A dragon fruit field in China]]\n[[File:Thanh Long ở Ninh Thuận.jpg|thumb|In [[Ninh Thuận Province|Ninh Thuận]], Vietnam]]\n\nAfter thorough cleaning of the seeds from the pulp of the fruit, the seeds may be stored when dried. The ideal fruit is unblemished and overripe.\n\nSeeds grow well in a compost or potting soil mix – even as a potted indoor plant. Pitaya cacti usually germinate after between 11 and 14 days after shallow planting. As they are cacti, overwatering is a concern for home growers. As their growth continues, these climbing plants will find something to climb on, which can involve putting aerial roots down from the branches in addition to the basal roots. Once the plant reaches a mature 10 pounds in weight, the plant may flower.{{Clarify|date=May 2012}}\n<!-- This sentence implies that pitaya maturity is measured by the plant's weight. Is that true? If so, why? -->\n\nCommercial plantings can be done at high density with between 1100 and 1350 plants per hectare. Plants can take up to five years to come into full commercial production, at which stage yields of 20 to 30 tons per hectare can be expected.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://amorentia.co.za/dragon-fruit/|title=Dragon Fruit - Amorentia Sweet Dragon Fruit|access-date=2018-06-05}}</ref>\n\nPitaya flowers bloom overnight and usually wilt by the morning.<ref>{{cite book|last=Boning|first=Charles R.|title=Florida's Best Fruiting Plants: Native and Exotic Trees, Shrubs, and Vines|year=2006|publisher=Pineapple Press, Inc.|location=Sarasota, Florida|isbn=978-1-56164-372-1|page=185}}</ref>  They rely on nocturnal [[pollinator]]s such as [[bat]]s or [[moth]]s for fertilization. Self-fertilization will not produce fruit in some species, and while cross-breeding has resulted in several \"self-fertile\" varieties, cross-pollinating with a second plant species generally increases fruit set and quality. This limits the capability of home growers to produce the fruit. However, the plants can flower between three and six times in a year depending on growing conditions. Like other cacti, if a healthy piece of the stem is broken off, it may take root in soil and become its own plant.\n\nThe plants can endure temperatures up to {{convert|40|C|F}} and very short periods of frost, but will not survive long exposure to freezing temperatures. The cacti thrive most in [[hardiness zone|USDA zones]] 10–11, but may survive outdoors in zone 9a or 9b.<ref name=morton/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/living/home-garden/article1977019.html|title=Dragon fruit surprisingly easy to grow|publisher=Miami Herald|author=Setzer, Kenneth|date=26 July 2014|accessdate=19 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320143829/http://www.miamiherald.com/living/home-garden/article1977019.html|archivedate=20 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n''Hylocereus'' has adapted to live in dry tropical climates with a moderate amount of rain. The dragon fruit sets on the cactus-like trees 30–50 days after flowering and can sometimes have 5-6 cycles of harvests per year. In numerous regions, it has escaped cultivation to become a weed and is classified as an [[invasive weed]] in some countries.<ref name=cabi/>\n\n=== Pests and diseases ===\nStems and fruits are susceptible to several diseases caused by fungi, bacteria, a [[nematode]], and a virus.<ref name=\":0\" /> Overwatering or excessive rainfall can cause the flowers to drop and fruit to rot. The [[bacterium]] ''[[Xanthomonas campestris]]'' causes the stems to rot. ''[[Dothiorella]]'' [[fungi]] can cause brown spots on the fruit.
